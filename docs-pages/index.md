# **Re**active **M**ultifluid and **Ki**netic **T**ransport in **1D**

ReMKiT1D is a framework for building 1D multi-fluid models of the tokamak Scrape-Off Layer with support for kinetic electron effects and collisional-radiative modelling. The framework is controlled through a Python interface available [here](https://github.com/ukaea/ReMKiT1D-Python), where users can find high-level examples and documentation.

For an overview of both the Fortran framework and the Python interface see the [code paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465524001188).
