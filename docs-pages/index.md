# **Re**active **M**ultifluid and **Ki**netic **T**ransport in **1D**

ReMKiT1D is a framework for building 1D multi-fluid models of the tokamak Scrape-Off Layer with support for kinetic electron effects and collisional-radiative modelling. The framework is controlled through a Python interface available [here](ADD LINK). The global user manual, covering both the framework and the Python wrappers, is available on the Python repository. 

For an overview of both the Fortran framework and the Python interface see the [following code paper](ADD ARXIV LINK).
